# STATE DIAGRAM

This state machine diagram example shows the process by which a person sets an appointment on their calendar.In the “Check date” composite state, the system checks the calendar for availability in a few different substates.

If the time is not available on the calendar, the process will be escaped. 

If the calendar shows availability, however, the appointment will be added to the calendar.
